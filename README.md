node-FRC
=======
### The [NodeJS][] ⇆ [FRC][] bridge


`node-FRC` exposes a variety of FRC functionality to node.js scripts.

Installation
------------

Install using `npm`, of course!

``` bash
$ npm install FRC
```

Or add it to the `"dependencies"` section of your `package.json` file.

Tests
------------
To test functionality is working please use [node-frc-test] in conjunction with one of the robot side tests such as [node-frc-test-java]. The libraries are split up because there is no reason to distribute tests with each `npm install` that are not able to be tested at install and require considerable effort to test. 


Driver Station
-----------

To be added at a later date
